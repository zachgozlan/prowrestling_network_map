Notebook with code for creating network maps of wrestling events

This notebook is most of what you need to create a network map of matches at NXT TakeOver events. 


I put a version I created after TakeOver XXV here: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/bvm1ul/oc_network_graph_every_nxt_takeover_match_all/

I have not uploaded my notebooks of the matches themselves or team membership ties; please contact me if you are interested.

Look out for a WrestleMania version of this notebook in the near future - I would like to make that interactive,
as that map is much more dense and would benefit from additional features (I'm currently - Sept 2019 - learning JavaScript and Tableau).
